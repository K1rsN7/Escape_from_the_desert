<p>The final work for the second course on the professional module "Development of program modules" was defended for a grade of 5! </p>

<h3 align="center">Story about the idea of creating a game</h3>
<p>At the end of the 2nd course it is necessary to present a console application in Java programming language.</p>
<p>The idea of the application was to make a console game on the principle of a wanderer with the search for a secret exit, which was generated randomly. </p>
<p>After the realization of this idea came the idea of complicating the game by adding obstacles (walls and pits).</p>
<p>Then came the idea to add a terminator, which would make the game even more difficult. Terminator acts on the principle of randomly generated action. </p>
<p>After that, the graphical design of the application was amended by using colored text in the console using ANSI codes.</p>
<h3 align="center">Controls</h3>
<p>Control was implemented by selecting actions by entering numbers in the application console.</p>
